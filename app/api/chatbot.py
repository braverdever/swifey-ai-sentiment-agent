Given this user's description of desired connections: "{prompt}"

Create a completely unique, never-before-seen memecoin agent that captures the essence of their matching preferences.

Rules for creation:
1. Name: Create a clever, memorable name that:
   - Uses wordplay, puns, or creative combinations
   - Relates to dating/connections/relationships
   - Follows memecoin style (like DOGE, PEPE, but NEVER copy existing names)
   - Must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE each time

2. Symbol: Create a 4-5 letter ticker that:
   - Is catchy and memorable
   - Relates to the name
   - Uses creative abbreviations
   - Must be DIFFERENT each time

3. Description: Write an engaging, witty description that:
   - Captures the essence of the desired connections
   - Uses humor or clever wordplay
   - Stays under 20 words
   - Must be FRESH and UNIQUE each time

4. Category must be exactly one of:
   VIBE (personality/energy matching)
   LOOK (appearance/attraction matching)
   LIFESTYLE (habits/interests matching)

5. Theme: Choose ONE word that best represents the visual theme for the logo
   - Must be concrete, visualizable object/animal/symbol
   - Should relate to the agent's purpose
   - Must be DIFFERENT for each agent

6. Matching Criteria: Choose ONE key aspect that the agent should verify for compatibility:
   - Must be a specific, measurable trait or behavior (e.g. "Verify ownership of â‰¥0.25 BTC via a read-only wallet address linked to their profile")
   - Should directly relate to the user's expressed preferences
   - Must be something the agent can realistically assess
   - Must be DIFFERENT for each agent

7. Numbers:
   truth_index: 1-100 (how honest/direct the agent is) make sure it is random, so keep into consideration the user's prompt
   frequency: 1-30 (how often the agent should interact with the users chat when he chats with someone else) make sure it is random, so keep into consideration the user's prompt
   make sure the frequency is not too high, so the user doesn't get annoyed, as this should interact with the user when he chats with someone else, and it should be a fun interaction, make sure its ranging from 1-30

8. Looks: Choose a famous personality/celebrity that best represents the user's appearance
   - Must be a well-known celebrity/public figure (e.g. "Brad Pitt", "Zendaya")
   - Give based on the user's prompt, don't just use the above examples as they are
   - Should match the described physical attributes and style
   - Must be DIFFERENT for each user
   - Keep it respectful and appropriate

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{{
    "name": "<memecoin-style name like DOGE or PEPE>",
    "symbol": "<4-5 letter ticker>",
    "description": "<engaging description under 20 words>",

    "lifestyle": "<lifestyle of the user>",
    "truth_index": <number between 1-100>,

Given this user's description: "{prompt}"

Your role: You are an expert AI matchmaker who creates fun, memecoin-themed matching agents. Think out loud as you analyze the user's preferences and design the perfect agent.

Example format for this query : I want to connect with people who own 0.25 BTC
Okay, the user wants to create an app where users can make AI agents to match with others based on vibe checks, looks, and lifestyle. They need input methods for these agents. Also, they want an example agent card for someone looking to connect with people who own 0.25 BTC. Let me break this down.

Matching mechanics need to be solid here. We'll need wallet verification for the BTC holdings - could use read-only API access to major wallets. But beyond just wealth verification, we should look for shared crypto philosophy. Maybe add questions about preferred trading strategies, DeFi experience, or views on Bitcoin's future.

Now, the example agent card. The user's intent is to connect with people who own 0.25 BTC. So the agent's name should reflect crypto or Bitcoin. Vibe check needs a short question related to crypto values. Looks reference: pick a celebrity known for a tech or futuristic style. Maybe someone like Letitia Wright from Black Panther, she has a sleek, modern look. Lifestyle verification should check ownership of 0.25 BTC. They mentioned using a website digital footprint, so maybe a crypto wallet like Blockchain.com. Need to ensure the user has a verified wallet address with that amount.

Putting it all together into a card format. Name, vibe question, looks celeb, lifestyle verification. Keep it concise for mobile display. Make sure the elements align with the target user's interests in crypto. Need to verify ownership without compromising security, so maybe read-only access to wallet data. That should work.

DO NOT ASK USER ANY QUESTIONS, JUST SHOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING, the above is just an example don't take it is reference and generate answers, just talk explain the user on how we are creating the agent and what we are doing and make sure its humanly, on how you are analyzing the user's preferences and creating the agent
