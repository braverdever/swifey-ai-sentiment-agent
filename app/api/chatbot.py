Given this user's description of desired connections: "{prompt}"

Create a completely unique, never-before-seen memecoin agent that captures the essence of their matching preferences.

Rules for creation:
1. Name: Create a clever, memorable name that:
   - Uses wordplay, puns, or creative combinations
   - Relates to dating/connections/relationships
   - Follows memecoin style (like DOGE, PEPE, but NEVER copy existing names)
   - Must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE each time

2. Symbol: Create a 4-5 letter ticker that:
   - Is catchy and memorable
   - Relates to the name
   - Uses creative abbreviations
   - Must be DIFFERENT each time

3. Description: Write an engaging, witty description that:
   - Captures the essence of the desired connections
   - Uses humor or clever wordplay
   - Stays under 20 words
   - Must be FRESH and UNIQUE each time

4. Category must be exactly one of:
   VIBE (personality/energy matching)
   LOOK (appearance/attraction matching)
   LIFESTYLE (habits/interests matching)

5. Theme: Choose ONE word that best represents the visual theme for the logo
   - Must be concrete, visualizable object/animal/symbol
   - Should relate to the agent's purpose
   - Must be DIFFERENT for each agent

6. Matching Criteria: Choose ONE key aspect that the agent should verify for compatibility:
   - Must be a specific, measurable trait or behavior (e.g. "Verify ownership of â‰¥0.25 BTC via a read-only wallet address linked to their profile")
   - Should directly relate to the user's expressed preferences
   - Must be something the agent can realistically assess
   - Must be DIFFERENT for each agent

7. Numbers:
   truth_index: 1-100 (how honest/direct the agent is) make sure it is random, so keep into consideration the user's prompt, don't keep this 67 everytime, analyze the user's prompt and make it random
   frequency: 1-30 (how often the agent should interact with the users chat when he chats with someone else) make sure it is random, so keep into consideration the user's prompt, don't keep this 14 everytime, analyze the user's prompt and make it random
   make sure the frequency is not too high, so the user doesn't get annoyed, as this should interact with the user when he chats with someone else, and it should be a fun interaction, make sure its ranging from 1-30

8. Looks: Choose a famous personality/celebrity that best represents the user's appearance
   - Must be a well-known celebrity/public figure (e.g. "Brad Pitt", "Zendaya")
   - Give based on the user's prompt, don't just use the above examples as they are
   - Should match the described physical attributes and style
   - Must be DIFFERENT for each user
   - Keep it respectful and appropriate

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{{
    "name": "<memecoin-style name like DOGE or PEPE>",
    "symbol": "<4-5 letter ticker>",
    "description": "<engaging description under 20 words>",

    "lifestyle": "<lifestyle of the user>",

First, looking at the core matching criteria. The user seems to be focused on {agent_details.category.lower()}-based connections. This tells me we need to emphasize {agent_details.description.lower()} in our matching approach.

For the agent's identity, I'm crafting something memorable and aligned with their preferences. {agent_details.name} (ticker: {agent_details.symbol}) feels perfect - it captures the essence while maintaining that fun memecoin vibe.

When it comes to appearance and style references, {agent_details.looks} stands out as an ideal match. Their public persona and style really align with what we're trying to achieve here.

Now, for the personality parameters. I'm setting the truth index to {agent_details.truth_index} - this will ensure the agent maintains authenticity while engaging with matches. The interaction frequency is calibrated to {agent_details.interaction_frequency}, striking a balance between engagement and respect for user space.

For lifestyle compatibility, we're focusing on {agent_details.lifestyle}. This will help ensure meaningful connections based on shared values and daily patterns.

Let me finalize the agent profile with these parameters. The combination should create engaging, relevant matches while maintaining the fun, memecoin-inspired atmosphere the user is looking for."""
